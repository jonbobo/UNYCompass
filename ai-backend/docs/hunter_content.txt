Mauro. “Thanks to Leonard, we have the privilege of honoring Evelyn Lauder, our ardent supporter who was devoted to Hunter. Leonard was supremely generous and very involved with the Evelyn Lauder Program and its students. We will miss him terribly.”Leonard met Evelyn while she was attending Hunter as an undergraduate.  She later became a top executive in the family company. In 1993, Evelyn founded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) to prevent and cure breast cancer by advancing the world’s most promising research. She always wanted Hunter to be part of the search for a cure. BCRF has given support to the laboratory of Hunter cancer researcher Dr. Jill Bargonetti since 2005.“Leonard and Evelyn Lauder brought a deep personal compassion to the fight against breast cancer,” Dr. Bargonetti said. “They were agents of change and hope and left a lasting impact on medicine and science, improving the lives of millions. I am grateful for their support of our research at Hunter.”Leonard Lauder was a lifelong art collector who gave peerless 20th-century works to several American museums.

BCRF has given support to the laboratory of Hunter cancer researcher Dr. Jill Bargonetti since 2005.“Leonard and Evelyn Lauder brought a deep personal compassion to the fight against breast cancer,” Dr. Bargonetti said. “They were agents of change and hope and left a lasting impact on medicine and science, improving the lives of millions. I am grateful for their support of our research at Hunter.”Leonard Lauder was a lifelong art collector who gave peerless 20th-century works to several American museums. He generously supported the arts at Hunter, where two curators of his personal collection are on the faculty. Emily Braun, distinguished professor at Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, has curated the Leonard A. Lauder Collection of Cubist Art since 1987.  Lynda Klich, associate professor and director of graduate studies in art history, has been curator of the Leonard A. Lauder Postcard Collection since 1999.In 2023, Mr. Lauder established the Leonard A. Lauder Exhibition and Catalogue Fund and a scholarship fund for graduate students in Art History. The fund provides support for exhibitions and catalogues published in connection with exhibitions held at the Hunter College Art Galleries as part of Hunter’s Advanced Certificate in Curatorial Studies Program. The fellowship provides full academic tuition annually for selected graduate students enrolled in the master’s program of art history. Including the incoming class, there are nine students funded by Mr. Lauder’s fellowship fund in art history. Many other students are benefiting from the exhibition fund.Leonard Lauder was the recipient of numerous honors and awards and was recognized nationally and internationally for his vision and generosity.  At the same time, he was a New Yorker through and through.  Hunter College is profoundly grateful for our special relationship with this remarkable man, which Mr. Lauder movingly described inhis letter:“New York City has meant the world to my family — my children, my parents and grandparents made their lives here — and to me, and Hunter is part of our New York City story.”
Hunter College mourns the passing of Leonard A. Lauder, a visionary friend and generous benefactor of the college and the husband of our late alumnaEvelyn Hausner Lauder HCHS ’54, HC’56, DHL ’04.Mr. Lauder passed away June 14 at the age of 92.A transformational business leader, humanitarian, and art collector, Leonard Lauder made a large and enduring philanthropic impact on Hunter, with a particular focus on nursing and the arts. Thechairman emeritusof The Estée Lauder Companies, he grew up in New York City and appreciated the opportunities it gave to him and Evelyn, who died in 2011 of breast cancer.“We are devastated at the loss of such a wise, gracious, cherished friend and thought partner,” said President Nancy Cantor. “We will be forever grateful for Leonard’s expansive vision of the impact that Hunter could make as an anchor institution in our home city. Time and again he brought not only his keen, strategic mind to the table to help figure out how to do that, but he also brought his resources to bear so generously on our collective plans. His philanthropic legacy utterly exemplifies Hunter’s motto,Mihi Cura Futuri, the Care of the Future is Mine.”In 2022, Leonard Lauder made an extraordinary and historic gift that established theEvelyn Lauder Community Care Nurse Practitioner Program, which strengthens Hunter’s Adult-Gerontology and Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner programs and prepares New York’s future healthcare leaders. The Evelyn Lauder program supports cohorts of fellows who work in community clinics in partnership with the New York Health + Hospitals Corporation, the nation’s largest public hospital system. It was the largest gift ever given to Hunter. Since its inception, the program has educated more than 50 nurse practitioners.Mr. Lauder wrote about his involvement with Hunter and his hopes for the Evelyn Lauder program ina letter posted on our website. Quoting the letter in part:“My wife, Evelyn, was a proud Hunter alumna and supported the college throughout her life. I honor her with this gift, to support the education of nurse practitioners who will be leaders in advancing the well-being of New Yorkers and others beyond our city.“I was so impressed with the nursing care Evelyn received during her life and I believe highly skilled nurse practitioners are key to improving access to good health for all Americans.”With an earlier gift in 2015, Mr. Lauder created the Evelyn H. Lauder Nursing Fund to support Evelyn H. Lauder Faculty Scholars and Evelyn H. Lauder Scholarships for nursing students.Mr. Lauder and his sons were also among the first donors to Hunter’s storiedMother’s Day Scholarship Fund Campaign, donating in honor of Evelyn beginning in 2006, a year after the campaign’s founding.“Leonard Lauder believed passionately in the importance of Hunter College and its nursing school in furthering the health and well-being of underserved communities in New York City,” said Joan Hansen Grabe Dean of the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing Ann Marie P. Mauro. “Thanks to Leonard, we have the privilege of honoring Evelyn Lauder, our ardent supporter who was devoted to Hunter. Leonard was supremely generous and very involved with the Evelyn Lauder Program and its students. We will miss him terribly.”Leonard met Evelyn while she was attending Hunter as an undergraduate.  She later became a top executive in the family company.

News/Spotlight/Four From Hunter College Go Abroad as Fulbright ScholarsJune 16, 2025ShareSajida Ahmed, Alison Juray, Andrew Loka, and Alp Doymaz.Here’s proof that a Hunter College education can send you all over the world!Four recent alumni are going abroad as Fulbright Scholars for the 2025 – 26 academic year: Sajida Ahmed MHC ’25, Alp Doymaz MHC ’25, Alison Juray ’24, and Andrew Loka ’24.A fifth alum, Maya Savoie ’24, also was chosen for a Fulbright, but declined the scholarship for other opportunities.Named for the late Senator J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.) and funded by the U.S. State Department, the Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers grants to promote U.S. interests through cultural exchange. It sends Americans to teach English in classrooms around the world and funds research across international borders.Hunter College has been designated a “Top Producer” of Fulbright Scholars many times during the past 15 years, showing its impact as a public institution providing educational opportunities to diverse young talent. Inspired by the varied life experiences students bring to the classroom, Hunter’s faculty and staff invest deeply in student success. For more than 150 years, Hunter has been one of the nation’s most diverse higher-education institutions and one of its most effective engines of social mobility.Ahmed majors in psychology and Arabic and is graduating with a GPA of 3.95. Last year, she won the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship to spend summer 2024 in Morocco. She has also worked for the CUNY Reading Corps, specializing as an early literacy tutor. Ahmed will teach English as a second language in Jordan next year and plans to pursue a master’s of education in school psychology.Doymaz majored in biological sciences, compiling a GPA of 3.9 over his four years. He is a research assistant at Rockefeller University in the Paul Cohen lab, which studies how the genetic variability of adipose tissue drives substantially different metabolic rates among people and determines significant differences in weight and health outcomes. He will conduct research in Germany. After completing his Fulbright year, Doymaz hopes to enter an MD-PhD program.Juray earned a BA in chemistry with minors in business studies and public health. She graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa and distinguished herself as an outstanding student leader in the Yalow Honors Program. She’s earning a master’s degree in health policy and economics at Weill Cornell, where she also volunteers at the Alonso Laboratory.

She plans to apply to MD-PhD programs.Loka was a Roosevelt Scholar and majored in political science, with a minor in international relations and legal studies. He graduated summa cum laude. He received a Grove Fellowship and the Mellon Public Humanities & Social Justice Fellowship, among other awards at Hunter and CUNY. His Fulbright will allow him to study the history of religious coexistence in Jordan, and how the Hashemite Kingdom maintains peaceful and positive relations between its religious minorities. After his Fulbright year, Loka plans to attend law school and then pursue a career in international law.Hunter’sOffice of Prestigious Scholarships and Fellowshipshas a stellar record of preparing students for competitive scholarships and fellowships. In recent years, the college has produced two Rhodes, three Marshall, seven Schwarzman, five Luce, eight Goldwater, and 43 Fulbright Scholars, among many other prestigious awardees.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

News/Spotlight/Hunter College Marks the 13th Anniversary of DACAJune 12, 2025SharePhoto: Via Wikimedia CommonsThis week the nation marks the 13thanniversary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an immensely successful program that provides temporary protection from deportation and work authorization to more than 800,000 immigrants who came here as children.More than 400,000 undocumented students, including many at Hunter College, are pursuing degrees, launching careers, and contributing meaningfully to their campuses, communities, and states.At Hunter, we value and protect our many undocumented students. OurImmigrant Student Success Centeradvocates for our undocumented and immigrant students and fosters a safe, empowering, and community of belonging to all students, regardless of status, through informative resources, advising, programming, scholarships, and advocacy.Hunter College also works collectively with higher-education partners across the country to increase public understanding of how immigration policies and practicesimpactour students, campuses, and communities. An important avenue for this advocacy is thePresidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, of which Hunter College President Nancy Cantor is a founding board member and Steering Committee co-chair.Dreamers at Hunter are pursuing rigorous programs in STEM, healthcare, teaching, and more — and are some of our most successful graduates. Hunter is extremely proud to have hosted cohorts of students supported in cooperation with the nationally prominentDREAM.USprogram that provides financial and other supports to dreamers.On this anniversary, we reflect on the contributions DACA recipients have made to our campus as students, alumni, faculty, and staff. At the same time, we recognize the determination of those who are not eligible for DACA, as well as the resilience of all who have weathered challenges to the program and emphasize the importance of establishing permanent protections for all Dreamers.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

An important avenue for this advocacy is thePresidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, of which Hunter College President Nancy Cantor is a founding board member and Steering Committee co-chair.Dreamers at Hunter are pursuing rigorous programs in STEM, healthcare, teaching, and more — and are some of our most successful graduates. Hunter is extremely proud to have hosted cohorts of students supported in cooperation with the nationally prominentDREAM.USprogram that provides financial and other supports to dreamers.On this anniversary, we reflect on the contributions DACA recipients have made to our campus as students, alumni, faculty, and staff. At the same time, we recognize the determination of those who are not eligible for DACA, as well as the resilience of all who have weathered challenges to the program and emphasize the importance of establishing permanent protections for all Dreamers.PreviousNext

News/Spotlight/She’s a 2025 Hunter Grad — and a 74-Year-Old GrandmotherJune 10, 2025ShareDorotea Levy de Szekely is living proof of lifelong learning.At 74, the Upper East Sider received her bachelor’s degree from Hunter College on May 30. A grandmother of three, born and raised in Argentina, her journey is a testament to the transformative power of education and the pursuit of knowledge at any age.De Szekely’s path to Hunter College shows resilience and fortitude. As a child, she had a learning disability, and her teachers told her that she didn’t have the brains to pursue higher education — or even to graduate high school!Facing such discouragement, she didn’t return to academia until she was in her 60s. As an older student, however, she excelled, earning an associate degree with a perfect 4.0 GPA from Borough of Manhattan Community College in2019— where she delivered the valedictory address. By then, the learning bug was in her bones, and she jumped at the chance to further her studies at Hunter.“The day that I stop learning, I will be dead! That's my motto,” de Szekely said. “This is just the beginning for me.”At Hunter, which she entered in the fall of 2019, de Szekely pursued a double major in German language and literature and English (with a concentration in creative writing), with a minor in French. She also found a vibrant and inclusive community, which she describes with profound emotion.“The skywalk epitomizes Hunter’s philosophy for me,” de Szekely said. “It’s a bridge that goes from the east to the west building, from the north to the south. When I see people walking — students, professors, and staff from all walks of life — it makes me feel like my heart is bursting out of my chest. It’s so amazing. That’s why I say this is the beginning for me.”Her family (a daughter, two sons, and three grandchildren) supported her belated studies.“They’re proud,” she shared, laughing about their reactions to her adapting to modern student slang, such as the term “rizz” for power of attraction and the texting acronym WDYM for “what do you mean?”“I have this amazing support group at home, my daughter, my grandchildren when they’re here, and my two sons. So, they’re all pushing me,” she said.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

As an older student, however, she excelled, earning an associate degree with a perfect 4.0 GPA from Borough of Manhattan Community College in2019— where she delivered the valedictory address. By then, the learning bug was in her bones, and she jumped at the chance to further her studies at Hunter.
“The day that I stop learning, I will be dead! That's my motto,” de Szekely said. “This is just the beginning for me.”
At Hunter, which she entered in the fall of 2019, de Szekely pursued a double major in German language and literature and English (with a concentration in creative writing), with a minor in French. She also found a vibrant and inclusive community, which she describes with profound emotion.
“The skywalk epitomizes Hunter’s philosophy for me,” de Szekely said. “It’s a bridge that goes from the east to the west building, from the north to the south. When I see people walking — students, professors, and staff from all walks of life — it makes me feel like my heart is bursting out of my chest. It’s so amazing. That’s why I say this is the beginning for me.”
Her family (a daughter, two sons, and three grandchildren) supported her belated studies.
“They’re proud,” she shared, laughing about their reactions to her adapting to modern student slang, such as the term “rizz” for power of attraction and the texting acronym WDYM for “what do you mean?”
“I have this amazing support group at home, my daughter, my grandchildren when they’re here, and my two sons. So, they’re all pushing me,” she said.

News/Spotlight/Hunter Researchers Help Struggling Areas With Heat-Mapping ToolJune 10, 2025ShareHow does Hunter College help struggling New York neighborhoods? Here’s one way!A new tool developed by researchers at Hunter College’s Urban Policy and Planning Department seeks to help advocacy groups and decision makers understand the distribution of heat in New York City.TheNYC Urban Heat Portal, launched on April 15, shows how rising temperatures affect different New York City’s neighborhoods, providing a guide to the most vulnerable communities. The poorest communities in the city are also the hottest ones, because they lack shade trees and other greenery and have a larger share of concrete and blacktop.A heat map generated by the NYC Urban Heat Portal.“To understand who is most at risk, we need to consider a range of temperature measures — like surface temperature, air temperature, and mean radiant temperature — and how they interact with neighborhood infrastructure like tree cover and building materials,” explained the lead researcher, Hunter Assistant Professor Mehdi P. Heris.The portal provides heat-exposure data through maps, visualizations, and explanations for public use, benefiting policymakers, planners, and community groups. It contains several new datasets that were developed exclusively for it and that will help city agencies to develop more effective policies to mitigate urban heat. Some mitigation measures are planting trees, building cool roofs, and creating green infrastructure.The research team included many Hunter students who brought fierce social-advocacy values to the project, Heris said. The team collaborated with city agencies including the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.The project exemplifies how Hunter acts as an anchor institution in New York City, by contributing high-impact research that shapes communities and policies.  It was developed in collaboration with researchers at Penn State'sInstitute of Energy and the Environmentand data scientists at thinktank BetaNYC and reflects input from community organizations including WE ACT, El Puente, South Bronx Unite, and others.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

News/Spotlight/Hunter’s Trademark Diversity Shines at 228th CommencementJune 5, 2025ShareHunter College’s trademark diversity lit up Barclays Center May 30 as the 155-year-old school celebrated its 228thCommencement — graduating more than 5,000 students and spotlighting Hunter as a beacon of social mobility, especially for immigrants.“This vibrant, diverse community of scholars and learners and professionals and community partners makes Hunter and our home of New York City the place to be,” said Hunter President Nancy Cantor to the more than 3,300 graduates and family members who filled the vast Brooklyn stadium.Cantor praised graduates for their fortitude, talents, and dreams and said that their education would enable them to make world-changing impact“Youare the ones we have been waiting for,” Cantor said, adding, “So, let’s give this graduating class, who will take their Hunter degrees, built on their diverse lived experiences, out into a world that needs a lot of change-making, a big round of hearty and hopeful applause!”Cantor said many students not only had overcome adversity to get their degrees but also lifted their fellow students along the way.“What more can we ask than to see our students, as students themselves, paving the way for others to succeed along with them?” she asked.Cantor cited Frank Mora — who dropped out of high school at 15 but later returned to school for a psychology degree and a business certificate, starting the Hunter chapter of the Association of Latino Professionals for America — and tahda queer, the winner of many prestigious scholarships, who advocated for queer students in STEM.Provost Manoj Pardasani emphasized statistics in underscoring Hunter’s diversity and promise. The Class of 2025 was the largest ever — 5,280 students — he said, noting that Hunter is home to about 22,000 undergraduates and 5,500 graduate students, most living in the city’s five boroughs, and many first-generation college students and as well as first-generation immigrants.“Hunter’s students exemplify New York — our grit, our smarts, our cosmopolitan yet small neighborhood ethos with its urban mix of newcomers and those who have been here for generations,” CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez told the graduates. “Our desire to be different and edgy and true to ourselves, our incredible welcomeness, and quintessential drive to be No. 1 and win.

Hunter’s Trademark Diversity Shines at 228th CommencementJune 5, 2025ShareHunter College’s trademark diversity lit up Barclays Center May 30 as the 155-year-old school celebrated its 228thCommencement — graduating more than 5,000 students and spotlighting Hunter as a beacon of social mobility, especially for immigrants.“This vibrant, diverse community of scholars and learners and professionals and community partners makes Hunter and our home of New York City the place to be,” said Hunter President Nancy Cantor to the more than 3,300 graduates and family members who filled the vast Brooklyn stadium.Cantor praised graduates for their fortitude, talents, and dreams and said that their education would enable them to make world-changing impact“Youare the ones we have been waiting for,” Cantor said, adding, “So, let’s give this graduating class, who will take their Hunter degrees, built on their diverse lived experiences, out into a world that needs a lot of change-making, a big round of hearty and hopeful applause!”Cantor said many students not only had overcome adversity to get their degrees but also lifted their fellow students along the way.“What more can we ask than to see our students, as students themselves, paving the way for others to succeed along with them?” she asked.Cantor cited Frank Mora — who dropped out of high school at 15 but later returned to school for a psychology degree and a business certificate, starting the Hunter chapter of the Association of Latino Professionals for America — and tahda queer, the winner of many prestigious scholarships, who advocated for queer students in STEM.Provost Manoj Pardasani emphasized statistics in underscoring Hunter’s diversity and promise. The Class of 2025 was the largest ever — 5,280 students — he said, noting that Hunter is home to about 22,000 undergraduates and 5,500 graduate students, most living in the city’s five boroughs, and many first-generation college students and as well as first-generation immigrants.“Hunter’s students exemplify New York — our grit, our smarts, our cosmopolitan yet small neighborhood ethos with its urban mix of newcomers and those who have been here for generations,” CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez told the graduates. “Our desire to be different and edgy and true to ourselves, our incredible welcomeness, and quintessential drive to be No. 1 and win.

Letter from Leonard A. Lauder (1933-2025)New York City has meant the world to my family—my children, my parents and grandparents made their lives here—and to me, and Hunter is part of our New York City story. My wife, Evelyn, was a proud Hunter alumna and supported the College throughout her life. I honor her with this gift, to support the education of nurse practitioners who will be leaders in advancing the well-being of New Yorkers and others beyond our city.I was so impressed with the nursing care Evelyn received during her life and I believe highly skilled nurse practitioners are key to improving access to good health for all Americans. Nurse practitioners are leaders on the front lines of primary care, especially now, as Americans face health care shortages in their communities. The advanced clinical training and graduate education they receive at world-class institutions like Hunter give nurse practitioners the knowledge and skill to supervise and manage critical aspects of care for people of all ages.When you become a Lauder Fellow, your commitment to community well-being is supported by the highest standards of professional preparation, both in the classroom and on the ground in New York City Health & Hospitals and other facilities where New Yorkers receive care. I know that every Lauder Fellow will help our neighbors, friends and family stay healthy, and be a driving force for health equity in our society. I am deeply proud to work with Hunter on this program, and see its benefits touch the lives of New Yorkers and beyond.

News/Love and Gratitude: How Hunter’s Mother’s Day Scholarship Campaign BeganMay 5, 2025ShareDavid Chapnick with Jose Ramon Perez Lope '14 and Mrs. ChapnickIt started with a son’s gift of love, then swelled into the gratitude of generations.When attorneyDavid Chapnickwrote a $25,000 check to the Hunter College Foundation creating a scholarship honoring his late mother, Goldie Kraft Chapnick ’30, he knew that he had birthed a great idea.The 2003 donation was noted briefly inGiving at Hunter, but it had not yet hatched into the decades long campaign that has raised almost $11 million for thousands of Hunter students. Chapnick, who became a trustee of the Hunter College Foundation, pressed the idea with then-Hunter College PresidentJennifer J. Raab.Hunter, after all, had been a women’s college for most of its more than a century of existence and had educated some of the most accomplished women in America – many of whom had been the first in their families to go to college. Of course, their relatives would want to honor these beloved figures. He and President Raab sent solicitations to a core group of 400 families of devoted alumni.The Mother’s Day Scholarship Campaign also put a notice in the Spring 2005 issue ofAt Hunter.“Did your mother go to Hunter?” the headline asked, adding, “This Mother’s Day give your mother a gift that honors her Hunter heritage and gives a new generation of students the opportunity for a Hunter education.”An idea contributed by President Raab greatly interested potential donors: “Gifts of $2,500 or more will be acknowledged in a special advertisement inThe New York Timeson Mother’s Day.”From there, the infant campaign grew quickly. Families and friends clamored to honor not only mothers, but the sisters, aunts, teachers, friends, and many other women who had enriched their lives.“From David’s first gift, this extraordinary campaign has provided thousands of students with scholarships that enable them to purse their education free from financial hardship.” said Hunter College Foundation Executive DirectorAlexis L. Eggleton. “It has generated many new donors, both as word spread about the campaign, and has Mother’s Day Scholarship recipients graduated, prospered, and have paid their success forward by becoming Mother’s Day donors themselves.”Since its start, love, gratitude, affection, and reverence have powered the Mother’s Day Scholarship Campaign year after year, leading to many repeat donations.The families of Joan Hansen Grabe ’60, Klara Apat Silverstein ’54, MA ’56; and Ruth Newman ’54 have donated every year.The list of donations will be studied for its insights into the history of Hunter College — and New York City.For example, in 2010, real-estate developer and former Consumer Affairs CommissionerBruce Ratnerand former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern donated in honor of “our friend and mentor,” Bess Myerson ’45, the former Miss America and consumer-affairs commissioner. In 2011, the owners ofThe New York Times, theOchs–Sulzbergerfamily, gave a gift in honor of Rachel Piexotto Hays Sulzberger 1878.Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the formerTimespublisher, still honors Piexotto, his great-grandmother, in the Mother’s Day rolls.PhilanthropistBruce Hoffman, a Hunter College Elementary School alumnus, embodies the notion of filial (and husbandly) piety. He has given Mother’s Day donations in honor of his grandmother Belle Steinhardt, 1903, and his great-aunt Rose Steinhardt, 1905. In 2023, he named the welcome center at Hunter’s Counseling & Wellness Services for his late wife, Dr. Perry D.

Families and friends clamored to honor not only mothers, but the sisters, aunts, teachers, friends, and many other women who had enriched their lives.“From David’s first gift, this extraordinary campaign has provided thousands of students with scholarships that enable them to purse their education free from financial hardship.” said Hunter College Foundation Executive DirectorAlexis L. Eggleton. “It has generated many new donors, both as word spread about the campaign, and has Mother’s Day Scholarship recipients graduated, prospered, and have paid their success forward by becoming Mother’s Day donors themselves.”Since its start, love, gratitude, affection, and reverence have powered the Mother’s Day Scholarship Campaign year after year, leading to many repeat donations.The families of Joan Hansen Grabe ’60, Klara Apat Silverstein ’54, MA ’56; and Ruth Newman ’54 have donated every year.The list of donations will be studied for its insights into the history of Hunter College — and New York City.For example, in 2010, real-estate developer and former Consumer Affairs CommissionerBruce Ratnerand former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern donated in honor of “our friend and mentor,” Bess Myerson ’45, the former Miss America and consumer-affairs commissioner. In 2011, the owners ofThe New York Times, theOchs–Sulzbergerfamily, gave a gift in honor of Rachel Piexotto Hays Sulzberger 1878.Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the formerTimespublisher, still honors Piexotto, his great-grandmother, in the Mother’s Day rolls.PhilanthropistBruce Hoffman, a Hunter College Elementary School alumnus, embodies the notion of filial (and husbandly) piety. He has given Mother’s Day donations in honor of his grandmother Belle Steinhardt, 1903, and his great-aunt Rose Steinhardt, 1905. In 2023, he named the welcome center at Hunter’s Counseling & Wellness Services for his late wife, Dr. Perry D. Hoffman, who was not a Hunter alum.It’s stories uniting the generations that have made the Mother’s Day Scholarship Campaign such a special part of giving at Hunter.
It started with a son’s gift of love, then swelled into the gratitude of generations.When attorneyDavid Chapnickwrote a $25,000 check to the Hunter College Foundation creating a scholarship honoring his late mother, Goldie Kraft Chapnick ’30, he knew that he had birthed a great idea.The 2003 donation was noted briefly inGiving at Hunter, but it had not yet hatched into the decades long campaign that has raised almost $11 million for thousands of Hunter students. Chapnick, who became a trustee of the Hunter College Foundation, pressed the idea with then-Hunter College PresidentJennifer J. Raab.Hunter, after all, had been a women’s college for most of its more than a century of existence and had educated some of the most accomplished women in America – many of whom had been the first in their families to go to college.

Together, the discussion and film screening will illuminate the legacy of the inimitable, irreplaceable Dr. Ruth—and what we can continue to learn from her cherished memory. In particular, this program promises to show how she drew on her personal experiences—from the loneliness that followed the loss of her family in the Holocaust, to that of living in an orphanage, and the challenges of rebuilding her life in America—to help individuals break free from the bonds of sexual stigmatization, hopelessness, and isolation.Dr. Ruth K. Westheimerbroke stigmas for more than 40 years, beginning in the 1980s with her nationally syndicated radio showSexually Speaking. She authored or co-authored 46 books on many topics and was named by Governor Kathy Hochul New York’s “Ambassador to Loneliness,” the first such position in the United States.

Together, the discussion and film screening will illuminate the legacy of the inimitable, irreplaceable Dr. Ruth—and what we can continue to learn from her cherished memory. In particular, this program promises to show how she drew on her personal experiences—from the loneliness that followed the loss of her family in the Holocaust, to that of living in an orphanage, and the challenges of rebuilding her life in America—to help individuals break free from the bonds of sexual stigmatization, hopelessness, and isolation.Dr. Ruth K.

News/Spotlight/CUNY’s Sorensen Center Moves to Hunter’s Roosevelt HouseJune 4, 2025ShareRoosevelt HouseThe Sorensen Center for International Peace and Justice at The City University of New York will relocate to a new home at the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, effective June 10, enabling the center to expand its work by targeting students across more disciplines and degree tracks. The center also named a new executive director, Hillary Schrenell, who brings decades of experience in higher education and government and most recently served as a senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for International Development.CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez and Hunter President Nancy Cantor made the announcements at Roosevelt House on Wednesday. They were joined by Gillian Sorensen, the former U.N. Assistant Secretary-General, who established the center in 2014 in memory of her late husband, Ted Sorensen (1928–2010), a leading lawyer, writer, and key adviser to President John F. Kennedy.Originally establishedat CUNY School of Law to train public-interest lawyers, the Sorensen Center is expanding its work to target students in public policy, human rights, urban studies, international studies, and pre-law. The new home at Hunter College will enable the center to collaborate with a broader range of undergraduate students and those pursuing master’s degrees in fields dedicated to peace and public service.The Sorensen Center fosters Ted Sorensen’s legacy by nurturing students dedicated to public service, equipping tomorrow’s leaders to preserve and enhance the ideals of peace and justice. Over the last decade, the Center’s fellowship program, speaker series and art exhibitions, among other initiatives, have enabled students to gain first-hand experience addressing issues of peace and justice, learn from leading figures from around the world, and engage in creative and strategic thinking on the most pressing issues of our time.Schrenell, whose appointment as executive director is effective immediately, joins the center with extensive experience in higher education and government. Most recently, she served as a senior adviser to the Chief Operating Officer at USAID. A graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, Schrenell has developed innovative programs to address global challenges, improve access to justice, and leverage global institutions as resources for local communities. She previously served as New York City’s deputy commissioner for international affairs, as director of project development at Columbia University's World Projects, and as an adviser to former U.S. permanent representatives to the United Nations, Samantha Power and Susan Rice.Schrenell succeeds Camille Massey, the Sorensen Center’s founding executive director.“The work of the Sorensen Center is needed now more than ever as students search for ways to address conflict in the world,”said CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez. “Ted Sorensen understood the importance of bringing divergent voices together to tackle pressing problems, and his legacy lives on at CUNY. I’m grateful to his family for expanding his work and their relationship with our community.”“The Sorensen Center embodies Ted Sorensen’s legacy of leadership intensely focused on the public good and its realization by assuring equal opportunity through equal rights and social justice,”said Hunter President Nancy Cantor. “That is what makes the Sorensen Center such an exquisite match for Hunter, with our identity so profoundly grounded in those principles. We’re beyond eager to work with Hillary Schrenell, Gillian Sorensen, and the Center to cultivate new generations of leaders who reflect the Sorensen values, especially through civic engagement with leading practitioners in law, urban affairs, public policy, human rights, and beyond.”“I am thrilled that the Sorensen Center has found a new home at Roosevelt House and look forward to working with the center’s new Executive Director, Hillary Schrenell, Roosevelt House Director Harold Holzer, and students,said Gillian Sorensen, who serves as honorary chair of the Sorensen Center. “The Center’s work will continue to honor my late husband Ted’s legacy of supporting aspirations for work in public service and politics and encouraging young people’s use of both the written and spoken word. We thank Camille Massey for her inspired leadership of the Sorensen Center over more than a decade since its inception.”“I am so excited to return to New York City to join the vibrantcommunity at the Roosevelt House and Hunter College as the new executive director of the Sorensen Center,”said Hillary Schrenell, incoming executive director of the Sorensen Center. “It is an honor to advance Ted Sorensen’s remarkable legacy through collaborations with students and scholars across the City University of New York system and with partners in civil society, government, and the private sector. I look forward to building on the first decade of the center’s success and working to realize a shared vision of peace and justice in New York City, across the United States, and globally.”“It is a privilege to welcome the Sorensen Center to the one-time family home where FDR crafted the social safety net, and where Eleanor Roosevelt not only advocated to extend its reach but evolved into a human rights champion in her own right,”said Harold Holzer, the Jonathan F. Fanton director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Insitute. “There could be no more perfect setting for the Sorensen Center than Roosevelt House — and we look forward to building a bridge here between the aspirations of the New Deal and the New Frontier, and beyond.”Ted Sorensen was a legendary speechwriter and adviser to President John F. Kennedy. Sorensen worked as a chief legislative aide to then-Senator Kennedy, collaborating with JFK on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1957 book “Profiles in Courage,” and famously helping to draft Kennedy’s legendary “Ask Not” inaugural address in 1961. President Kennedy memorably called Sorensen his “intellectual blood bank.”After leaving the White House, Sorensen joined the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and served as an adviser to Senator Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign. Remaining deeply engaged in domestic and international affairs for decades thereafter, Sorensen also wrote several acclaimed books, among them: “Kennedy” (1965); “The Kennedy Legacy: A Peaceful Revolution for the Seventies” (1969); “Watchman in the Night: Presidential Accountability after Watergate” (1976); “Why I am a Democrat” (1996); and a memoir, “Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History” (2008).Roosevelt House, an integral part of Hunter College since 1943, re-opened in 2010 as a public policy institute honoring the distinguished legacies of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, who lived here from 1908 until 1933. Its mission is three-fold: to educate students in public policy and human rights, to support research, and to foster creative dialogue and civic engagement through public programming. Roosevelt House also offers tours and exhibits that bring the history of the Roosevelts to a broad audience.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

Assistant Secretary-General, who established the center in 2014 in memory of her late husband, Ted Sorensen (1928–2010), a leading lawyer, writer, and key adviser to President John F. Kennedy.Originally establishedat CUNY School of Law to train public-interest lawyers, the Sorensen Center is expanding its work to target students in public policy, human rights, urban studies, international studies, and pre-law. The new home at Hunter College will enable the center to collaborate with a broader range of undergraduate students and those pursuing master’s degrees in fields dedicated to peace and public service.The Sorensen Center fosters Ted Sorensen’s legacy by nurturing students dedicated to public service, equipping tomorrow’s leaders to preserve and enhance the ideals of peace and justice. Over the last decade, the Center’s fellowship program, speaker series and art exhibitions, among other initiatives, have enabled students to gain first-hand experience addressing issues of peace and justice, learn from leading figures from around the world, and engage in creative and strategic thinking on the most pressing issues of our time.Schrenell, whose appointment as executive director is effective immediately, joins the center with extensive experience in higher education and government. Most recently, she served as a senior adviser to the Chief Operating Officer at USAID. A graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, Schrenell has developed innovative programs to address global challenges, improve access to justice, and leverage global institutions as resources for local communities. She previously served as New York City’s deputy commissioner for international affairs, as director of project development at Columbia University's World Projects, and as an adviser to former U.S. permanent representatives to the United Nations, Samantha Power and Susan Rice.Schrenell succeeds Camille Massey, the Sorensen Center’s founding executive director.“The work of the Sorensen Center is needed now more than ever as students search for ways to address conflict in the world,”said CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez. “Ted Sorensen understood the importance of bringing divergent voices together to tackle pressing problems, and his legacy lives on at CUNY. I’m grateful to his family for expanding his work and their relationship with our community.”“The Sorensen Center embodies Ted Sorensen’s legacy of leadership intensely focused on the public good and its realization by assuring equal opportunity through equal rights and social justice,”said Hunter President Nancy Cantor. “That is what makes the Sorensen Center such an exquisite match for Hunter, with our identity so profoundly grounded in those principles. We’re beyond eager to work with Hillary Schrenell, Gillian Sorensen, and the Center to cultivate new generations of leaders who reflect the Sorensen values, especially through civic engagement with leading practitioners in law, urban affairs, public policy, human rights, and beyond.”“I am thrilled that the Sorensen Center has found a new home at Roosevelt House and look forward to working with the center’s new Executive Director, Hillary Schrenell, Roosevelt House Director Harold Holzer, and students,said Gillian Sorensen, who serves as honorary chair of the Sorensen Center. “The Center’s work will continue to honor my late husband Ted’s legacy of supporting aspirations for work in public service and politics and encouraging young people’s use of both the written and spoken word. We thank Camille Massey for her inspired leadership of the Sorensen Center over more than a decade since its inception.”“I am so excited to return to New York City to join the vibrantcommunity at the Roosevelt House and Hunter College as the new executive director of the Sorensen Center,”said Hillary Schrenell, incoming executive director of the Sorensen Center. “It is an honor to advance Ted Sorensen’s remarkable legacy through collaborations with students and scholars across the City University of New York system and with partners in civil society, government, and the private sector. I look forward to building on the first decade of the center’s success and working to realize a shared vision of peace and justice in New York City, across the United States, and globally.”“It is a privilege to welcome the Sorensen Center to the one-time family home where FDR crafted the social safety net, and where Eleanor Roosevelt not only advocated to extend its reach but evolved into a human rights champion in her own right,”said Harold Holzer, the Jonathan F. Fanton director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Insitute. “There could be no more perfect setting for the Sorensen Center than Roosevelt House — and we look forward to building a bridge here between the aspirations of the New Deal and the New Frontier, and beyond.”Ted Sorensen was a legendary speechwriter and adviser to President John F. Kennedy. Sorensen worked as a chief legislative aide to then-Senator Kennedy, collaborating with JFK on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1957 book “Profiles in Courage,” and famously helping to draft Kennedy’s legendary “Ask Not” inaugural address in 1961. President Kennedy memorably called Sorensen his “intellectual blood bank.”After leaving the White House, Sorensen joined the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and served as an adviser to Senator Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign. Remaining deeply engaged in domestic and international affairs for decades thereafter, Sorensen also wrote several acclaimed books, among them: “Kennedy” (1965); “The Kennedy Legacy: A Peaceful Revolution for the Seventies” (1969); “Watchman in the Night: Presidential Accountability after Watergate” (1976); “Why I am a Democrat” (1996); and a memoir, “Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History” (2008).Roosevelt House, an integral part of Hunter College since 1943, re-opened in 2010 as a public policy institute honoring the distinguished legacies of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, who lived here from 1908 until 1933. Its mission is three-fold: to educate students in public policy and human rights, to support research, and to foster creative dialogue and civic engagement through public programming. Roosevelt House also offers tours and exhibits that bring the history of the Roosevelts to a broad audience.PreviousNextOffice of Communicationsfor media information and moreHunter on DemandEnjoy virtual lectures, discussions and readings by members of Hunter’s distinguished faculty.Join UsFollow UsNEWS SPOTLIGHTJune 23, 2025Hunter College Mourns Friend and Benefactor Leonard A.

Most recently, she served as a senior adviser to the Chief Operating Officer at USAID. A graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, Schrenell has developed innovative programs to address global challenges, improve access to justice, and leverage global institutions as resources for local communities. She previously served as New York City’s deputy commissioner for international affairs, as director of project development at Columbia University's World Projects, and as an adviser to former U.S. permanent representatives to the United Nations, Samantha Power and Susan Rice.Schrenell succeeds Camille Massey, the Sorensen Center’s founding executive director.“The work of the Sorensen Center is needed now more than ever as students search for ways to address conflict in the world,”said CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez. “Ted Sorensen understood the importance of bringing divergent voices together to tackle pressing problems, and his legacy lives on at CUNY. I’m grateful to his family for expanding his work and their relationship with our community.”“The Sorensen Center embodies Ted Sorensen’s legacy of leadership intensely focused on the public good and its realization by assuring equal opportunity through equal rights and social justice,”said Hunter President Nancy Cantor. “That is what makes the Sorensen Center such an exquisite match for Hunter, with our identity so profoundly grounded in those principles. We’re beyond eager to work with Hillary Schrenell, Gillian Sorensen, and the Center to cultivate new generations of leaders who reflect the Sorensen values, especially through civic engagement with leading practitioners in law, urban affairs, public policy, human rights, and beyond.”“I am thrilled that the Sorensen Center has found a new home at Roosevelt House and look forward to working with the center’s new Executive Director, Hillary Schrenell, Roosevelt House Director Harold Holzer, and students,said Gillian Sorensen, who serves as honorary chair of the Sorensen Center. “The Center’s work will continue to honor my late husband Ted’s legacy of supporting aspirations for work in public service and politics and encouraging young people’s use of both the written and spoken word. We thank Camille Massey for her inspired leadership of the Sorensen Center over more than a decade since its inception.”“I am so excited to return to New York City to join the vibrantcommunity at the Roosevelt House and Hunter College as the new executive director of the Sorensen Center,”said Hillary Schrenell, incoming executive director of the Sorensen Center. “It is an honor to advance Ted Sorensen’s remarkable legacy through collaborations with students and scholars across the City University of New York system and with partners in civil society, government, and the private sector. I look forward to building on the first decade of the center’s success and working to realize a shared vision of peace and justice in New York City, across the United States, and globally.”“It is a privilege to welcome the Sorensen Center to the one-time family home where FDR crafted the social safety net, and where Eleanor Roosevelt not only advocated to extend its reach but evolved into a human rights champion in her own right,”said Harold Holzer, the Jonathan F. Fanton director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Insitute. “There could be no more perfect setting for the Sorensen Center than Roosevelt House — and we look forward to building a bridge here between the aspirations of the New Deal and the New Frontier, and beyond.”Ted Sorensen was a legendary speechwriter and adviser to President John F. Kennedy. Sorensen worked as a chief legislative aide to then-Senator Kennedy, collaborating with JFK on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1957 book “Profiles in Courage,” and famously helping to draft Kennedy’s legendary “Ask Not” inaugural address in 1961. President Kennedy memorably called Sorensen his “intellectual blood bank.”After leaving the White House, Sorensen joined the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and served as an adviser to Senator Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign. Remaining deeply engaged in domestic and international affairs for decades thereafter, Sorensen also wrote several acclaimed books, among them: “Kennedy” (1965); “The Kennedy Legacy: A Peaceful Revolution for the Seventies” (1969); “Watchman in the Night: Presidential Accountability after Watergate” (1976); “Why I am a Democrat” (1996); and a memoir, “Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History” (2008).Roosevelt House, an integral part of Hunter College since 1943, re-opened in 2010 as a public policy institute honoring the distinguished legacies of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, who lived here from 1908 until 1933. Its mission is three-fold: to educate students in public policy and human rights, to support research, and to foster creative dialogue and civic engagement through public programming. Roosevelt House also offers tours and exhibits that bring the history of the Roosevelts to a broad audience.
The Sorensen Center for International Peace and Justice at The City University of New York will relocate to a new home at the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, effective June 10, enabling the center to expand its work by targeting students across more disciplines and degree tracks. The center also named a new executive director, Hillary Schrenell, who brings decades of experience in higher education and government and most recently served as a senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for International Development.
CUNY Chancellor Félix V. Matos Rodríguez and Hunter President Nancy Cantor made the announcements at Roosevelt House on Wednesday. They were joined by Gillian Sorensen, the former U.N. Assistant Secretary-General, who established the center in 2014 in memory of her late husband, Ted Sorensen (1928–2010), a leading lawyer, writer, and key adviser to President John F. Kennedy.
Originally establishedat CUNY School of Law to train public-interest lawyers, the Sorensen Center is expanding its work to target students in public policy, human rights, urban studies, international studies, and pre-law. The new home at Hunter College will enable the center to collaborate with a broader range of undergraduate students and those pursuing master’s degrees in fields dedicated to peace and public service.
